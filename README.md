# Laralella
Laralella = [Laravel](https://github.com/laravel/laravel) + [Gentelella](https://github.com/puikinsh/gentelella)


##Laravel
One of the Most Popular and Highly Rated PHP Framework

##Gentelella
One of the Most Popular and Highly Rated Bootstrap Admin Template

so I got some inspiration to merge these two to create Larallela having Back-end Power of Laravel and Front-end Power of Gentellela and Bootstrap.

The Project is functional but un-optimized and as s Lazy Programmer I haven't created all the Pages but Main Dahsboard pages, Form page, all Error pages and a Plain page is added to get Started...
